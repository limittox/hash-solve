***Improve performance***

Current performance:
100,000 words   |   5 rules = 3.85 secs

Possible bottlenecks:
> hashlib md5 function (only 0.45 secs)
> Accessing list is slow (No - it is fast)

> Rules Class - *PROBLEM*

Possible solutions:
> Place the md5 function in the md5 file, to make calls faster

> The rule class is making it slower
> Placing functions inside a dictionary makes execution faster
